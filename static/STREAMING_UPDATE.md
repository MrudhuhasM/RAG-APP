# Streaming Support Implementation

## Overview
The frontend has been updated to support real-time streaming of responses from the RAG backend using Server-Sent Events (SSE).

## Changes Made

### 1. JavaScript Updates (`static/js/app.js`)

#### Modified `handleQuery()` Function
- Replaced standard fetch with streaming response handling
- Added SSE (Server-Sent Events) reader implementation
- Implemented real-time token display as they arrive from the backend
- Added support for multiple event types:
  - **status**: Shows processing status (e.g., "Rewriting query", "Retrieving documents")
  - **token**: Displays answer tokens in real-time
  - **sources**: Shows source documents after answer completion
  - **error**: Handles and displays errors gracefully

#### New `displaySources()` Helper Function
- Separated source display logic for reusability
- Handles empty sources gracefully
- Works with both streaming and history results

#### Key Features
- **Real-time Feedback**: Users see status updates during processing
- **Progressive Display**: Answer appears character-by-character as it streams
- **Visual Cursor**: Blinking cursor shows active streaming
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages

### 2. CSS Updates (`static/css/styles.css`)

#### New Streaming Styles
- `.streaming-status`: Status message styling during processing
- `.status-icon`: Animated pulse effect for status indicators
- `.cursor-blink`: Blinking cursor animation for streaming text
- `.error-message`: Error message styling
- `.no-sources`: Empty state styling

#### New Animations
- `blink`: Cursor blinking effect
- `pulse`: Status icon pulsing effect

## User Experience Flow

1. **User asks a question**
   - Button shows loading spinner
   - Results section appears immediately

2. **Status Updates** (progressive)
   - "Processing your question..."
   - "Rewriting query..."
   - "Generating query embedding..."
   - "Retrieving relevant documents..."
   - "Reranking retrieved documents..."
   - "Generating final answer..."

3. **Answer Streaming**
   - Tokens appear one by one
   - Blinking cursor shows active streaming
   - Smooth, natural reading experience

4. **Sources Display**
   - Appears after answer completes
   - Cursor disappears
   - Sources are expandable/collapsible

5. **Completion**
   - Answer and sources saved to history
   - Button re-enabled for next query

## Technical Details

### Stream Format
```javascript
data: {"type": "status", "data": "Rewriting query."}
data: {"type": "token", "data": "The"}
data: {"type": "token", "data": " answer"}
data: {"type": "sources", "data": [...]}
```

### Error Handling
- Network errors caught and displayed
- Parse errors logged to console
- Stream interruptions handled gracefully
- User always sees meaningful feedback

## Benefits

1. **Improved UX**: Users see progress instead of waiting
2. **Perceived Performance**: Feels faster with progressive display
3. **Transparency**: Users understand what is happening
4. **Engagement**: More interactive and responsive feel
5. **Modern**: Matches contemporary AI chat interfaces
