      "*   **Confession and Ahimsa:** A pivotal moment was a childhood confession involving stealing gold from his brother. This led to a profound realization about the power of *ahimsa* (non-violence) and a desire to avoid causing harm to others, influencing his dietary choices. (Source: 36, 42)\n",
      "*   **Indian Vegetarianism:** Gandhi became increasingly concerned about the health and well-being of Indians, particularly in the context of British rule and the effects of colonial diets. He saw vegetarianism as a way to promote physical and moral strength among Indians. (Source: 39, 41, 47)\n",
      "*   **Influence of the Vegetarian Movement:** Gandhi was deeply involved in the Indian Vegetarian Movement, advocating for its spread and promoting its benefits. (Source: 32, 33, 35, 38)\n",
